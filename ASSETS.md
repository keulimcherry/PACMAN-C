# Assets

This project requires external assets (spritesheet and audio). These are not included in the repository due to licensing.

Required assets (place in `assets/` folder next to executable):
- `spritesheet.png` - Sprite atlas used by the game.
- `Intro.wav`
- `chomp.wav`
- `death.wav`
- `eat_ghost.wav`
- `ghost_running_away.wav`
- `eat_fruit.wav`
- `power_siren.wav`
- `ghost_turn_blue.wav`
- `high_score.wav`

If you have original Pac-Man assets you must ensure you have the right to redistribute them. Prefer creating your own assets or using royalty-free assets.
